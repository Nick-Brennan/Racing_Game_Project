##OOP Racing Game
### WDI Weekend Project
### Technologies Used
*So far, HTML with the HTML5 Canvas playing a central role, jQuery / Javascript, and CSS*

###Existing features
*Two players can race eachother against an animated starfield with randomly generated asteroids approaching head-on at procedurally generated postions and velocities. Players can move in all 4 directions. Collision between player avatars and asteroids result in the player's position being reset to the start and the destruction of the asteroid in a fiery explosion with coresponding SFX. The first player to make it all the way to the right side of the screen wins the round. At the start of play, or even during, players can select the look of their avatar from drop down lists at the top of the page. There is a background soundtrack that can be muted with a dedicated mute button. The field of play resizes itself dynamically with the window (currenty, resizing the window to overly narrow dimensions produces layout weirdness)*

###Planned features
*Keep track of wins by player. Calculate scores based on time and store the high score for a round. Upgrade the win condition from an alert to a winner page.*
